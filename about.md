		Hi there :wave:, I'm Alexander, a software developer currently living in the Netherlands. From time to time I write blog posts on what I'm working on, topics that interest me or just share some thoughts on our life. Feel free to reach out, I'm always up for a chat about code, side projects or the best coffee spots in Amsterdam.
